            <h1>Hi, I'm Melvin Cheng</h1>
            <p>I am a sophmore at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Economics. Actively seek experiences that can aid in development as a programmer and data analyst. Heavily driven to explore the junction of technology and practical applications to drive efficiency and creativity. Outside of academics I love the sport of tennis, basketball, and football, and enjoy playing music for others and performing.</p>

                <h2>Tennis</h2>
                <p>I picked up tennis in sixth grade as the first sport I ever tried. Instantly, I fell in love with the rhythm of the game, the sound of the ball meeting the strings, the satisfying screech of sneakers against the court, and the quiet tension that filled the air during each rally. 
Over time, tennis became more than just a sport to me as it became a lesson in patience and resilience. The court taught me that success isn’t about perfection but the willingness to keep playing the next point and to keep showing up even when your serves keep missing or your opponent seems unbeatable. I learned to think strategically, to read my opponent’s movements, and to keep calm under pressure.
Even now, I carry those lessons off the court. Whether I’m facing academic deadlines or personal challenges, I remind myself of the same mindset I had before every match: focus, adapt, and keep moving forward. Tennis didn’t just build my athletic ability but also shaped the way I look at life. I will always hold the lessons that I had gained from my lessons learning tennis and use them to shape my development as I go into future endeavors.
